## Leveraging Synthetic Data to Advance Organizational Research

Welcome to the GitHub repository for "Leveraging Synthetic Data to Advance Organizational Science" This repository is structured to facilitate an understanding and exploration of the research presented in our article.

- **Study_one**: Analysis of the first part of our study, for GATB data.
  
- **Study_two**: Analysis of the second part of our study, for CCL leadership data.

- **Demo**: Code demo for generating synthetic data. 

As mentioned in our paper, synthetic data is a promising data-sharing method in organizational research, but it still requires further development. We cannot share our data in violation of existing data management policies. However, we believe that as the acceptance of synthetic data in organizational research increases and technology advances, we will be able to share data in the form of synthetic data in the future.

For GATB data, please contact the National Center for O*NET Development (https://www.onetcenter.org/).
For CCL data, please contact the Center for Creative Leadership (https://www.ccl.org/).
