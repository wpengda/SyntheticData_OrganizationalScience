## Leveraging Synthetic Data to Advance Organizational Research

Welcome to the GitHub repository for "Leveraging Synthetic Data to Advance Organizational Science" This repository is structured to facilitate an understanding and exploration of the research presented in our article.

- **Study_one**: Analysis of the first part of our study, for GATB data.
  
- **Study_two**: Analysis of the second part of our study, for CCL leadership data.

- **Demo**: Code demo for generating synthetic data. 

Regarding data sharing, as mentioned in our paper, synthetic data is a promising method in organizational research, but it still requires further development. Our paper serves as a case in point, illustrating that we cannot share the original datasets nor the synthetic datasets derived from them, as this would **violate our existing data management policies**. However, we are hopeful that synthetic data will be shared in the future as its acceptance in organizational research increases and technology advances. This is the central point of our paper. 

Although we cannot share data, we will share all analysis code and demonstrations for generating synthetic data. 

For specific data inquiries, please contact the National Center for O*NET Development (https://www.onetcenter.org/) regarding the GATB dataset, and the Center for Creative Leadership (https://www.ccl.org/) regarding the CCL dataset.
